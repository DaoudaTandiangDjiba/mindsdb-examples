1585,US,"Similar in style and aging potential to the winery's 2009, and blended with amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot, this Cabernet Sauvignon from mighty Howell Mountain is rich in spicy blackberry and clove, the tannins soft and juicy.",,91,80.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Prim Family
1586,Portugal,"This is a smooth and generous wine. It is rich, full-bodied and packed with dark plum flavor, but it's the ripe, velvet character that is so appealing. It's almost ready to drink, although the firm tannins and minerality at the end suggest it will be better from 2016.",,91,22.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta de la Rosa
1587,US,"A solid wine for the price, this begins with honeydew and lime aromas. Flavors start with a spicy cinnamon apple before diving into buttered squash, melon and fresh lime, with a dash of salt.",Estate,91,15.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Castoro Cellars
1588,Portugal,"From the eastern vineyards of the Douro, in Douro Superior, this estate wine is heavily structured while showing rich fruit and impressive tannins. The texture is strongly mineral, complex and hinting at the concentration from fruit grown in this hot, dry climate. Drink from 2016.",Quinta dos Quatro Ventos,91,22.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Aliança
1589,France,"Perfumed and off dry, this rich wine has spice, structure and a floral character. It is so young with its white fruits, hint of lychee and lime-juice acidity. The wine needs to age to reveal its potential. Drink from 2018.",Seppi Landmann Zinnkoeplé Grand Cru,91,36.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann
1590,US,The new American oak barrel fermentation and aging steals the show on this wine. Notes of vanilla and woodspice overpower the variety's melon and apple aromas and flavors. There are some good things going on but it's hard to get at them.,The Reserve,87,25.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Chardonnay,14 Hands
425,Spain,"Raspberry, red currant and a pinch of oaky maple make up the nose on this Tinto Fino that sports a medium-weight body with medium-level intensity. Red-berry flavors follow the nose, while a crisp finish with red plum and raspberry flavors wraps things up.",Crianza,87,27.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Trus
426,US,"A first release, this wine offers light suggestions of red apple, herbs and tropical fruit. It's medium bodied yet leaner in style with tart acids but the concentration doesn't seem all there.",,87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Va Piano
427,France,"This wood-aged wine conveys mint aromas and new-wood flavors. It is rich, full in the mouth and developing quickly. The black currant fruitiness is fresh, giving a delicious, juicy wine to drink from 2016.",Cuvée Lucie,87,,Bordeaux,Médoc,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Les Hauts de Tousquiron
428,US,"This presents a big, buttery, bold style, with no apologies for the full body and ripe fruit surrounded by toasty, oaky aromas and flavors. This is dry, rich in texture, and more savory or smoky rather than fruity.",Chandler Vineyard,87,30.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Chardonnay,McGrail
429,US,"Heavy aromas and flavors of oak and smoke accompany ripe black cherry and boysenberry for a rich mixture. This wine is deeply colored, full bodied and pumped up with the flavors of heavily toasted oak. A firm but not harsh texture accompanies the almost sweet taste of all that oak.",Freakshow,87,20.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Michael David
430,US,"This wine offers notes of Red Hots, coffee, vanilla and herbs. Cherry and blackberry flavors are sweet and viscous in feel backed by dry tannins.",Reserve,87,23.0,Idaho,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards
5,Spain,"Deep, dense and pure from the opening bell, this Toro is a winner. Aromas of dark ripe black fruits are cool and moderately oaked. This feels massive on the palate but sensationally balanced. Flavors of blackberry, coffee, mocha and toasty oak finish spicy, smooth and heady. Drink this exemplary Toro through 2023.",Numanthia,95,73.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
6,Spain,"Slightly gritty black-fruit aromas include a sweet note of pastry along with a hint of prune. Wall-to-wall saturation ensures that all corners of one's mouth are covered. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and chocolate are highly impressive and expressive, while this settles nicely on a long finish. Drink now through 2024.",San Román,95,65.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
7,Spain,"Lush cedary black-fruit aromas are luxe and offer notes of marzipan and vanilla. This bruiser is massive and tannic on the palate, but still lush and friendly. Chocolate is a key flavor, while baked berry and cassis flavors are hardly wallflowers. On the finish, this is tannic and deep as a sea trench. Drink this saturated black-colored Toro through 2023.",Carodorum Único Crianza,95,110.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Bodega Carmen Rodríguez
